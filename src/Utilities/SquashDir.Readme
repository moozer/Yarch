For this to works, you must have autofs running and automounting the resulting .squashfs file.

Hints...

in /etc/auto.master I added the line
/mnt/moozer/squashfs /etc/auto.squashfs.loop --timeout=30 --ghost

and created a file called /etc/auto.squashfs.loop containing
* -fstype=squashfs,ro,loop :/home/moozer/squashfs/&.squashfs

Restart autofs after changing the config files.
This makes all nn.squashfs files placed in /home/moozer/squashfs to be accessible at /mnt/moozer/squashfs/nn
